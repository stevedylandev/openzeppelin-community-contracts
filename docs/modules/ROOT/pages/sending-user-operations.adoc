= Sending User Operations

This walks you through the complete process of preparing and sending xref:account-abstraction.adoc#useroperation[UserOperations] to the xref:account-abstraction.adoc#useroperation[EntryPoint] contract. You'll learn how to create, sign, and execute them, as well as handle their results.

UserOperations are a powerful abstraction layer that enable more sophisticated transaction capabilities compared to traditional Ethereum transactions. To get started, you'll need to an account, which you can get by xref:account-abstraction.adoc#account_factory[deploying a factory] for your implementation.

NOTE: Consider funding your account with native currency (i.e. ETH) if you're not using a xref:account-abstraction.adoc#paymaster[paymaster]

== Bundle a `UserOperation`

To bundle a `UserOperation`, you'll need to prepare the operation with all required fields and then package it into a format that can be sent to the EntryPoint contract. This process involves creating a properly structured operation with fields like sender address, nonce, gas limits, and calldata. The operation must be signed before it can be executed, and you may optionally include paymaster data for transaction sponsorship.

=== Preparing a UserOp

A UserOperation is a struct that contains all the necessary information for the EntryPoint to execute your transaction. You'll need the `sender`, `nonce`, `accountGasLimits` and `callData` fields to construct a `PackedUserOperation` that can be signed later (to populate the `signature` field).

TIP: Specify `paymasterAndData` with the address of a paymaster contract concatenated to `data` that will be passed to the paymaster's validatePaymasterUserOp function to support sponsorship as part of your user operation.

Here's how to prepare one using https://viem.sh/[viem]:

[source,typescript]
----
import { getContract, createWalletClient, http, Hex } from 'viem';

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account, // See Viem's `privateKeyToAccount`
  chain, // import { ... } from 'viem/chains';
  transport: http(),
})

const entrypoint = getContract({
  abi: [/* ENTRYPOINT ABI */],
  address: '0x<ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS>',
  client: walletClient,
});

const userOp = {
  sender: '0x<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>',
  nonce: await entrypoint.read.getNonce([sender, 0n]),
  initCode: "0x" as Hex,
  callData: '0x<CALLDATA_TO_EXECUTE_IN_THE_ACCOUNT>',
  accountGasLimits: encodePacked(
    ["uint128", "uint128"],
    [
      100_000n, // verificationGasLimit
      300_000n, // callGasLimit
    ]
  ),
  preVerificationGas: 50_000n,
  gasFees: encodePacked(
    ["uint128", "uint128"],
    [
      0n, // maxPriorityFeePerGas
      0n, // maxFeePerGas
    ]
  ),
  paymasterAndData: "0x" as Hex,
  signature: "0x" as Hex,
};
----

In case your account hasn't been deployed yet, make sure to provide the `initCode` field as `abi.encodePacked(factory, factoryData)` to deploy the account within the same UserOp:

[source,typescript]
----
const deployed = await publicClient.getCode({ address: predictedAddress });

if (!deployed) {
  userOp.initCode = encodePacked(
    ["address", "bytes"],
    [
      '0x<ACCOUNT_FACTORY_ADDRESS>',
      encodeFunctionData({
        abi: [/* ACCOUNT ABI */],
        functionName: "<FUNCTION NAME>",
        args: [...],
      }),
    ]
  );
}
----

==== Estimating gas

To calculate gas parameters of a `UserOperation`, developers should carefully consider the following fields:

* `verificationGasLimit`: This covers the gas costs for signature verification, paymaster validation (if used), and account validation logic. While a typical value is around 100,000 gas units, this can vary significantly based on the complexity of your signature validation scheme in both the account and paymaster contracts.

* `callGasLimit`: This parameter accounts for the actual execution of your account's logic. It's recommended to use `eth_estimateGas` for each subcall and add additional buffer for computational overhead.

* `preVerificationGas`: This compensates for the EntryPoint's execution overhead. While 50,000 gas is a reasonable starting point, you may need to increase this value based on your UserOperation's size and specific bundler requirements.

NOTE: The `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` values are typically provided by your bundler service, either through their SDK or a custom RPC method.

IMPORTANT: A penalty of 10% (`UNUSED_GAS_PENALTY_PERCENT`) is applied on the amounts of `callGasLimit` and `paymasterPostOpGasLimit` gas that remains unused if the amount of remaining unused gas is greater than or equal to 40,000 (`PENALTY_GAS_THRESHOLD`).

=== Signing the UserOp

To sign a UserOperation, you'll need to first calculate its hash using the EntryPoint's `getUserOpHash` function, then sign this hash using your account's signature scheme, and finally encode the resulting signature in the format that your account contract expects for verification.

[source,typescript]
----
const userOpHash = await entrypoint.read.getUserOpHash([userOp]);
userOp.signature = await eoa.sign({ hash: userOpHash });
----

NOTE: The previous example assumes that the account is owned by a single ECDSA signer without any particular signature format.

=== Sending the UserOp

Finally, to send the user operation you can call `handleOps` on the Entrypoint contract and set yourself as the `beneficiary`. 

[source,typescript]
----
// Send the UserOperation
const userOpReceipt = await walletClient
  .writeContract({
    abi: [/* ENTRYPOINT ABI */],
    address: '0x<ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS>',
    functionName: "handleOps",
    args: [[userOp], eoa.address],
  })
  .then((txHash) =>
    publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash: txHash,
    })
  );

// Print receipt
console.log(userOpReceipt);
----

TIP: Since you're bundling your user operations yourself, you can safely specify `preVerificationGas` and `maxFeePerGas` in 0.

== Using a Bundler

For better reliability, consider using a bundler service. Bundlers provide several key benefits: they automatically handle gas estimation, manage transaction ordering, support bundling multiple operations together, and generally offer higher transaction success rates compared to self-bundling.
